       The first condition of happiness is peace of mind.
       The only difference between a good day and a bad one is your attitude.
       Happiness lives in simple things. True happiness is cheap:
       if you have to pay dearly for it, then know that it is fake.
       Happiness is going to bed knowing that you can sleep as much as you want. :))
